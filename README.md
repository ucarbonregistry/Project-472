______________
NSL Sugars Limited (NSL), is one of the most efficient sugar companies in south India and a sugar
arm of ‘NSL Group’. NSL Group entered the ‘sugar’ business being related to agro-commercial crop
business. NSL Group which has its core strength in Agri business like Seeds, Cotton & Sugar taken
over the “Sahakari Sakkare Kharkane Niyamit”, Aland for 30 years on LROT (Lease, Rehabilitate,
Operate Transfer) basis of 1250 TCD sugar plant & took possession of the factory on 06-March-2010.
The Project is owned by “M/s NSL Sugars Limited, Unit-II, Aland” and hereby called as Project
Proponent.
NSL Sugars has operated plant at 1250 TCD during 2010-11 season. Simultaneously plant has been
expanded to 7000 TCD with 34 MW co-generation commissioned in 2011-12 season. The plant has
been working with the state of art equipment(s) for sugar to achieve 7000 TCD and 34 MW bagasse
based co-gen power plant.
The current project activity included under this UCR document is located in Bhusnoor Village, Aland
Taluka in the district of Gulbarga in Karnataka state. The main scope of carbon credits is due to the
existing 34 MW bagasse-based co-generation unit at the Bhusnoor sugar mill which exports
electricity to grid.
These scope is well recognized activity under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of carbon
emissions as compared to their respective baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid electricity with
the export power produced & supplied by NSL.

The purpose of the project activity is to utilize available mill generated bagasse effectively for
generation of steam and electricity for both in-house consumption and to export surplus electricity to
the power grid. The project meets the captive steam and power requirement of sugar unit, cogeneration (Cogen) plant auxiliaries and power requirement of the facilities. The balance power is exported to Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL).

As per design specification, the unit has an existing co-generation unit with installed capacity of 34
MW turbine, out of which 2% of gross electricity generated is assumed to be imported electricity and
40% of gross electricity generated is assumed to be used for captive-consumption and the remaining
gross electricity is exported to the grid. PLF for the plant is assumed to be 60% and the plant is
operational since commissioning on 05/08/2011.
The major equipment of the project activity comprises 170 Tons Per Hour (TPH) capacity steam
generator with the outlet steam parameters of 110 atm and 540oC, 34 MW capacity turbine generator
set Multi stage Extraction cum Condensing (MEC) type.

The design of the plant is to operate for 340 days per annum, which includes 310 days of crushing
season, and balance 30 days during off-season (plant operates on an average of 8 months in a year
including the crushing season and some off-season months). The plant is designed with all other
auxiliary plant systems like bagasse/biomass handling system with storage and processing
arrangements, ash handling system, water treatment plant, cooling water system and cooling tower,
De-Mineralized (DM) water plant, compressed air system and balance of plant including high
pressure piping etc. for its successful operation. The provision of extraction cum condensing machine
© Universal CO2 Emission And Offset Registry Private Ltd
allows the possibility of operating the plant during the off-season with the saved bagasse and procured
surplus biomass residues

NSL Sugars Limited, Unit-II, Aland, project activity has implemented the steps which are well
recognized activities under GHG mechanisms due to the reduction of carbon emissions as compared
to the baseline scenarios viz. displacement of grid electricity with the export power produced &
supplied from the co-generation unit. Thus, NSL Sugars project activity helps to contribute to
emission reductions as well as SDG targets creating a sustainable pathway.
